Goal : Designing and building a Signal clone app to redefine privacy.


**Signal**  is a cross-platform centralized encrypted messaging service developed by the Signal Technology Foundation and Signal Messenger LLC. It uses the Internet to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes, images and videos.

## The Situation.

After WhatsApp's privacy and user data sharing agreements release privacy of individuals became a really big issue. And there came Signal. Signal is a free messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption to keep your messages private. When you send a message, the only people who can see that message are the recipients â€” not even the company that runs Signal can see what you send.

## Research.
